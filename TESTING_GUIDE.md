# Comprehensive Testing Guide - Phase 1 Polish & Showcase

This guide provides systematic testing instructions for the newly implemented error handling, form validation, loading states, and UI polish features. Follow these tests in order to validate the current phase implementation without deviating into unrelated bugs.

## üéØ Testing Scope

**What to Test:**

## üîÑ Testing Sequence

Follow this sequence for most efficient testing:

1. **Start with error boundaries** (affects everything else)
2. **Test form validation** (most user-facing)
3. **Verify loading states** (common across app)
4. **Check empty states** (visual polish)
5. **Validate toast system** (user feedback)
6. **Review demo data** (showcase readiness)

This testing approach ensures you validate the current phase improvements without getting distracted by existing functionality bugs or unrelated issues.
