# From Days to Seconds: How Modern APIs Revolutionized a Legacy System

## The Challenge: A System Trapped in Time

A state employment agency was struggling with a critical bottleneck in its unemployment claims processing. Their core system, built on decades-old COBOL code, relied on archaic looping operations that caused significant delays. Processing each claim took **2 to 3 days**, leading to a huge backlog, frustrated citizens, and a massive strain on staff. The agency needed a way to dramatically improve efficiency without a complete and costly system overhaul.

## The Solution: A Strategic Modernization

Our mission was to find a targeted, high-impact solution that could coexist with the legacy architecture. We identified a key opportunity to bypass the slow, internal processing by using modern, external APIs. My approach was to build an intermediary layer using **ColdFusion** that could:

* Pull data from the old system.
* Process the information by leveraging powerful new APIs.
* Push the results back into the legacy system, completing the claims processing cycle.

This strategy allowed the agency to modernize a critical business function without the risk and expense of a full system rewrite.

## The Results: A New Standard of Speed

The impact was immediate and transformative. By re-routing the claims through the new API-driven process, the processing time was slashed from **2-3 days down to mere seconds**.

* **99% Reduction in Processing Time:** Claims that once took days to complete were processed in a fraction of a minute.
* **Improved Citizen Service:** The agency could provide faster service to those in need, reducing wait times and improving public perception.
* **Increased Operational Efficiency:** Staff could focus on more complex tasks, as the automated process handled the bulk of the workload.

## Key Takeaways

This project demonstrated that complex, long-standing problems in legacy systems can be solved with **innovative thinking and targeted integration**. It’s not always about tearing down the old; sometimes, it’s about strategically building new layers that enable old systems to perform in a modern world. This approach delivers a fast return on investment and minimizes risk.
