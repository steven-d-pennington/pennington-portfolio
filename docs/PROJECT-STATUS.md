## 🔑 Authentication Status

**Current User**: `steven@spennington.dev` with `admin` role  
**Login Methods**: Email/password ✅, Google OAuth ✅  
**Dashboard Access**: Full admin access to project management ✅

## 🚀 Development Environment

**Dev Server**: `npm run dev` (Turbopack) or `npm run dev:safe` (webpack)  
**Build Status**: ✅ Compiling successfully with warnings only  
**Database**: ✅ All migrations applied, RLS policies active  
**Authentication**: ✅ Multi-provider working with session management  

## 📂 Key Files for Next Development

**Will Need to Create**:
- `src/app/dashboard/users/page.tsx` - Main users dashboard
- `src/components/dashboard/CreateUserModal.tsx` - User creation interface
- `src/components/dashboard/UserDetailsModal.tsx` - User editing interface
- `src/app/api/users/route.ts` - User management API endpoints

**Will Need to Update**:
- `src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Add "Users" navigation item
- `src/lib/server-database.ts` - Add user management functions
- `src/types/database.ts` - User management type definitions (if needed)

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Create `/dashboard/users` page** - Main user management interface
2. **Build user table component** - Display all users with roles and status
3. **Add user creation modal** - Quick user setup with role assignment
4. **Implement user search/filtering** - Find users by various criteria
5. **Update navigation** - Add "Users" section to dashboard menu

## 💡 Development Notes

- **ESLint is configured** to show warnings instead of errors for faster development
- **Turbopack is primary** build tool, webpack available as fallback via `dev:safe`
- **Database operations use admin client** in API routes to bypass RLS where appropriate
- **All authentication flows tested** and working with session refresh capabilities
- **Project dashboard fully functional** - can create, edit, view, and manage projects
