            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              In the late 1990s, the internet was a luxury. Getting online meant paying for an expensive dial-up connection from providers like AOL, and high-speed access was an unreachable dream for most, requiring costly T1 lines. The market was ripe for a disruption.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Our company was founded on a simple premise: to make the internet accessible and affordable for everyone. We set out to challenge the giants and prove that a small, agile team could create a better way to connect.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Our first strategic move was to offer an incredible price point: a flat fee of just <strong>$79 per year</strong> for unlimited dial-up internet. This was a completely unheard-of price at the time and proved to be a powerful disruptor. We didn&apos;t need a massive marketing budget; our value spoke for itself. We grew quickly through the most effective channels available: <strong>word-of-mouth referrals</strong> and local newspaper advertisements.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              As high-speed cable was still a distant reality, we saw a new opportunity to bring high-speed internet to our customers. We were among the first to experiment with the then-nascent <strong>2.4 GHz wireless technology</strong> from companies like Cisco. Our team successfully engineered and built <strong>the very first city-wide wireless network in a major metro area</strong>, enabling us to offer high-speed internet access that was previously out of reach for most homes and businesses. We soon expanded our wireless network to nearby communities.

              In addition to building the network infrastructure, we operated with a full-stack mentality, creating an entire ecosystem of products in-house. This allowed us to control every aspect of the user experience and innovate at a rapid pace.
